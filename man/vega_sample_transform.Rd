NOTE: Some parameters are required to be 'arrays'.  In the case where a parameter must be an array but is a single line, wrap it in 'I()', (asis), to ensure it is properly handled.

\details{
The **sample** transform randomly samples a data stream to create a smaller stream. As input data objects are added and removed, the sampled values may change in first-in, first-out manner. This transform uses [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling) to maintain a representative sample of the stream.
